Crypto loan smart contract pool.

Borrow 50/100 cryptos.


 

1.  Introduction.

In this project we shall build the smart contract that could help users to borrow pre selected on chain crypto coins.

 

2. How does it work?

Users can select the crypto currency that they would like to borrow.

Once they have selected the crypto currency, they must decide how much would they like to borrow and must select the crypto currency

from their assets that they would like to collaterate.

The minimum collateral amount would be 50% of their selected crypto currency at the current market value.

To avoid liquidation users have the choice to increase the collateral amount or decrease the borrowing amount.

Users can repay their dept at any time they wish.

Users are charged an interest rate of 10% per year of the amount borrowed. The interest is compounded every minute while the user owes the loan.

 



3.  Pre selected crypto coins pool.

The initial default list will have few pre selected crypto coins available for loans.

3.1 Users could request new crypto coins to be added to the loan list.

The minimum number of request for new crypto coin will be 10 request from different users.

3.2 Users also have a choice to request that certain crypto coins be removed from the loan list.

To qualify for this request a user must have used the loan facility at least once.

The minimum number of request for crypto coins to be removed from the loan list will be 20 request from different users.

 

 4. Supply and demand.

4.1 To do once the campaine is over:

To stimulate supply and demand, users have a choice to invest their assets on the crytpo loan pool.

They could earn an interest on their assets.
